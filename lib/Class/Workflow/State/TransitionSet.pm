=head1 NAME

Class::Workflow::State::TransitionSet - A state that implements transition meta
data using Set::Object.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package MyState;
	with "Class::Workflow::State::TransitionSet";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a concrete role that implements C<transitions>, C<has_transition> and
C<has_transitions> as required by L<Class::Workflow::State>, and adds
C<add_transitions>, C<remove_transitions> and C<clear_transitions> as well.

Transition storage is implemented internally with L<Set::Object>.

Unlike L<Class::Workflow::State::TransitionHash> this role does not require
transitions to respond to the C<name> method, but as a consequence you must
refer to the transitions by value.

Note that you may construct like this:

	Class->new(
		transitions => \@transitions,
	);

and the transition set will be coerced from that array reference.

=head1 METHODS

See L<Class::Workflow::State>
